# CSC 496 RCV Presentations

## Overview

You will give a presentation on an algorithm or scheme related to Ranked Choice Voting (RCV). You will be assigned a date and a topic. You will have ~20 minutes to present your topic to the class including Q&A.

Students will be required to do all of the following:

* Present the algorithm/scheme at a high level.
* Explain the motivation for the algorithm/scheme and any relevant history.
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm/scheme relative to "Voting method criteria" (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#Voting_method_criteria and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#Voting_method_criteria)
* Have already implemented the algorithm/scheme in Python.
* Have computed the winner of all the elections in our corpus using the algorithm/scheme.

(Other students will be expected to implement the algorithm in subsequent weeks.)

## Timeline

* Wednesday, January 24: Create list of potential algorithms/schemes in class.
* Monday, January 29: In-class algorithm/scheme AND date selection
* Monday, February 12: In-class presentations (3)
* Monday, February 19: In-class presentations (3)
* Monday, February 26: In-class presentations (3)
* Monday, March 5: Spring Break
* Monday, March 12: In-class presentations (3)
* Monday, March 19: In-class presentations (3)

The selection process will be random-ish:

1. We will use a random number generator to select the order in which students will choose.
2. In order, students will choose either a date or an algorithm/scheme.
3. After we have gone through the list once, we will repeat **in reverse order** the process until all dates and algorithms/schemes have been chosen.
