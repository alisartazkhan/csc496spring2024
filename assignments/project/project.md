# CSC 496 Project

## Overview

You will work on a semester-long project related to Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) or Gerrymandering/Redistricting.  

You will propose your project.

## Independent or Team Projects

You may work on this project individually or in teams of two. 

If you wish to work in teams, the project must be very substantial, and your proposal must also include the following:

* a very clear plan for how you will divide the work.  
* a team contract reflecting that division

Note, also, that the project will be graded as a whole.  If one team member does not contribute, both team members will receive the same grade based on the totality of the project's progress.

## Project Duplication

It is OK for students to choose (very) similar projects.

## Timeline

* Wednesday, January 24: Discuss project ideas in class.  Everybody should have at least two half-baked ideas---baked enough to say out loud in front of peers.
* Wednesday, January 31: Project proposal due.  Submit a 1 page (or less) proposal describing your project.
* Wednesday, February 7: Project proposal presentation to class.  5-10 minutes per student.
* Wednesday, February 14: Project proposal presentations continued if necessary.


The proposal should include the following as appropriate:
  * A description of the problem you are trying to solve.
  * A description of how your project will solve the problem.
  * A description of the data you will use.
  * A description of the evaluation you will perform.
  * A description of the visualization you will create.
  * A description of the user interface you will create.
  * A description of the project's deliverables.



## Sample Project Ideas

#### Ranked Choice Voting

1. Implement a web or mobile app that allows users to create and conduct RCV elections
2. Implement a web or mobile app that allows users to create and conduct multi-winner RCV elections.  AKA Single Transferable Vote (STV).
2. Develop a new RCV algorithm and compare it to existing algorithms and existing criteria.  It **must** address a perceived shortcoming of existing algorithms.
3. Conduct user surveys to determine characteristics of RCV results that are important to voters.  And, surveys on what sorts of algorithms are understandable/acceptable to voters. This must include statistical analysis and actionable summary of the results
4. Analyze historical RCV elections (domestic and international) to determine how their choice of algorithm/scheme affected the results.

#### Gerrymandering/Redistricting

1. Develop system to create redistricting plans that are "legal".
2. Develop a system to improve an existing redistricting plan according to some criteria/metric.
3. Implement the Utility Ghost system  https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07377
